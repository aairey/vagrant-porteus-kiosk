# vagrant-porteus-kiosk

This is a Vagrantfile to start a preconfigured Porteus Kiosk 3.6 client.

## Prerequisites

You need the following application installed on your system:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [vagrant](https//www.vagrantup.com/)

## Usage

You can use the Vagrantfile from this repo as follows.

```
git clone https://github.com/aairey/vagrant-porteus-kiosk.git
vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
vagrant ssh
```
The default root password is "test".

## Notes
Currently only VirtualBox is supported.

The Setup Wizard is already run with the defaults and following selections made:
* DHCP, wired connection
* Firefox as browser
** No Location Bar
* No HTTP Proxy
* VNC Server enabled, password is "test"
* SSH enabled, root password is "test"

This repository may not seem of much use now, but in the future I hope to make and track changes here.
